Actually, that was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.

You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.

Oh, COME ON! I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I'm going to run this through again on "pots and pans." If that man's straight, then I am sober. With spicy club sauce.

What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine! I'm a monster!! Douche chill! You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose.

Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where?
