    <h2 class="subheadline-general">Weave Privacy and Policy</h2>
    <p class="copy-general">Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Weave, LLC. (“Weave”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Weave and has been created to provide information about our company and merchant processing products and services (the “Products”) to you as a visitor to our Site and/or user of our Products (“you” and/or “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Weave’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), that is collected from visitors to the Site and users of the Products.</p><br />
    <h3 class="subheadline-general">Information We Collect</h3>
    <p class="copy-general">When you interact with us through our Site or Products, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p><br />
    <h3 class="subheadline-general">Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site or Products</h3>
    <p class="copy-general">We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, purchase a Product, register your Product or otherwise use certain Products. In addition, when you access or use a Product we may collect metrics on your activities, such as web pages visited, length of visit, and which features of our product you use. Wherever Weave collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p><br />
    <p class="copy-general">By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us through the Site or in connection with any Product or Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Weave and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p><br />
    <h3 class="subheadline-general">Other Information</h3>
    <p class="copy-general">Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Weave through the Site or any Product, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Weave may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Weave affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors&#39; Internet service providers and the use of our Products. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p><br />
    <p class="copy-general">In operating the Site, we may use a technology called &#39;cookies&#39;. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. However, these cookies are not required for site functionality and you are not required to accept any cookies to use this site. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features. As noted above, on most web browsers you may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site. By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. The Site also automatically captures IP addresses. Weave uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movement, ensure the security of your interaction with the Site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p><br />
    <h3 class="subheadline-general">Managing Cookies and Do Not Track</h3>
    <p class="copy-general">You can inform the web services with which the Site or Products integrate (such as social buttons, widgets, and other embedded features or content) that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits to be collected. Enabling “Do Not Track” in your web browser settings is an easy way to accomplish this. The “Do Not Track” browser setting is supported by recent versions of major browsers, including Firefox 5&#43;, Internet Explorer 9&#43;, Safari 5.1&#43;, and Google Chrome. Please consult www.donottrack.us on how to enable this privacy setting on your browser. You can also change the way your browser handles cookies. Already existing cookies can be deleted. Please consult www.allaboutcookies.org on how to manage or delete cookies in your browser.</p><br />
