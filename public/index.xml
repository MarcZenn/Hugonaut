&lt;p&gt;Actually, that was a box of Oscar&amp;rsquo;s legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. It&amp;rsquo;s so watery. And yet there&amp;rsquo;s a smack of ham to it. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. It&amp;rsquo;s like my heart is getting hard. Buster&amp;rsquo;s in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, COME ON! I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. If you&amp;rsquo;re suggesting I play favorites, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don&amp;rsquo;t care for Gob. I want to cry so bad, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can spare the moisture. [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I&amp;rsquo;m going to run this through again on &amp;ldquo;pots and pans.&amp;rdquo; If that man&amp;rsquo;s straight, then I am sober. With spicy club sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you expect, Mother? I&amp;rsquo;m half machine! I&amp;rsquo;m a monster!! Douche chill! You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? It looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for dragons… in the future. No, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. It&amp;rsquo;s like my heart is getting hard. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he&amp;rsquo;d gone in head first, like Pete Rose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That&amp;rsquo;s a cross. Across from where?&lt;/p&gt;

This Site is operated by Weave and has been created to provide information about our company and merchant processing products and services (the “Products”) to you as a visitor to our Site and/or user of our Products (“you” and/or “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Weave’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), that is collected from visitors to the Site and users of the Products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&#34;subheadline-general&#34;&gt;Information We Collect&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;copy-general&#34;&gt;When you interact with us through our Site or Products, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&#34;subheadline-general&#34;&gt;Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site or Products&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;copy-general&#34;&gt;We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, purchase a Product, register your Product or otherwise use certain Products.

    &lt;h3 class=&#34;subheadline-general&#34;&gt;Our Use of your Personal Data and Other Information&lt;/h3&gt;

Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&#34;subheadline-general&#34;&gt;Strategic Partners; Service Providers&lt;/h3&gt;

These companies are obligated to protect your Personal Data and may have their own privacy policies if you link to or access their websites or systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&#34;subheadline-general&#34;&gt;Legal Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;copy-general&#34;&gt;Weave may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Weave, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or Products or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&#34;subheadline-general&#34;&gt;Your Choices&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;h1 class=&#34;subheadline-general&#34;&gt;Standardizing the Cannabis Industry&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;copy-general&#34;&gt;Weave is a platform to standardize the regulated cannabis industry. Our first product is a fully compliant cannabis POS system and Resource planning platform. We leverage cutting edge technologies to provide advanced analytics that give business owners more power than existing POS systems today. Currently our products are integrated with the METRC tracking system (Colorado,Alaska, Oregon) with future integrations on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;copy-general&#34;&gt;Weave’s journey began in 2014, when amendment 64 passed in Colorado and recreational cannabis use was legalized. Our Founder’s came from successful exits in technology startups and careers in enterprise and mobile software. An introduction to a local medical cannabis business operator opened our eyes to the cumbersome, antiquated, and broken workflows needed to stay compliant with new regulations. METRC established the traceability system that cannabis entities were required to use, but there was a lack of internal tracking, operations, and reporting for these businesses to thrive. After interviewing countless operators and owners, Weave saw a great opportunity to build a robust, scalable platform for inventory management and all aspect of resource planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;copy-general&#34;&gt;Weave believed the industry deserved better systems, and in 2015, pivoted the company from building consumer applications on top of existing cannabis platforms to first build a point of sale product that would set the standard for years to come. Weave was fortunate in gaining support from one of the largest technology companies in the world, Google. In 2015, utilizing Google’s infrastructure and technologies, was able to build one of the world’s most advanced and modern inventory management systems. The company has always been predicated on building world-class products and making our customers smile. Starting in late 2016, cannabis retailers that are licensed with their state are able to now forget their inventory woes and complicated compliance regulations by partnering with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;copy-general&#34;&gt;At Weave, we believe in legalization, but more importantly, we believe that the right technology is needed to bring transparency to an industry that has thrived in criminal corners of the country in the past. Our world is evolving and progressing and it is Weave’s mission to become the backbone for an industry that needs stability, transparency, compliance, innovation, and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Second Blog Post</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://weaveiq.com/images/metrc.png&#34; alt=&#34;Example image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A night of heterosexual intercourse. Buster&amp;rsquo;s in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman&amp;rsquo;s terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to have bees in here. Mission Accomplished. It&amp;rsquo;s OUR nausea. Chickens don&amp;rsquo;t clap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I&amp;rsquo;ve ever taken! ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you&amp;rsquo;re Annyong! I made a huge tiny mistake. She&amp;rsquo;s always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom&amp;rsquo;s awesome. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. She calls it a Mayonegg. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Got a big ass room at the travelodge. What a fun, sexy time for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. In fact, it was a box of Oscar&amp;rsquo;s legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. Hey, look at that – you&amp;rsquo;re mean sober, too. Michael, I&amp;rsquo;m your older brother. I&amp;rsquo;ll never be proud of you. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she&amp;rsquo;s shaped like a… she&amp;rsquo;s the belle of the ball! We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn&amp;rsquo;t make that in three months. Come on! I may have committed some light treason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I&amp;rsquo;m white! The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://weaveiq.com/images/golang_gopher.png&#34; alt=&#34;Example image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, that was a box of Oscar&amp;rsquo;s legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. It&amp;rsquo;s so watery. And yet there&amp;rsquo;s a smack of ham to it. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. It&amp;rsquo;s like my heart is getting hard. Buster&amp;rsquo;s in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, COME ON! I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. If you&amp;rsquo;re suggesting I play favorites, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don&amp;rsquo;t care for Gob. I want to cry so bad, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can spare the moisture. [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I&amp;rsquo;m going to run this through again on &amp;ldquo;pots and pans.&amp;rdquo; If that man&amp;rsquo;s straight, then I am sober. With spicy club sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you expect, Mother? I&amp;rsquo;m half machine! I&amp;rsquo;m a monster!! Douche chill! You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? It looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for dragons… in the future. No, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. It&amp;rsquo;s like my heart is getting hard. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he&amp;rsquo;d gone in head first, like Pete Rose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That&amp;rsquo;s a cross. Across from where?&lt;/p&gt;
