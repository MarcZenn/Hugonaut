&lt;p&gt;Actually, that was a box of Oscar&amp;rsquo;s legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. It&amp;rsquo;s so watery. And yet there&amp;rsquo;s a smack of ham to it. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. It&amp;rsquo;s like my heart is getting hard. Buster&amp;rsquo;s in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, COME ON! I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. If you&amp;rsquo;re suggesting I play favorites, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don&amp;rsquo;t care for Gob. I want to cry so bad, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can spare the moisture. [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I&amp;rsquo;m going to run this through again on &amp;ldquo;pots and pans.&amp;rdquo; If that man&amp;rsquo;s straight, then I am sober. With spicy club sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you expect, Mother? I&amp;rsquo;m half machine! I&amp;rsquo;m a monster!! Douche chill! You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? It looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for dragons… in the future. No, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. It&amp;rsquo;s like my heart is getting hard. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he&amp;rsquo;d gone in head first, like Pete Rose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That&amp;rsquo;s a cross. Across from where?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A night of heterosexual intercourse. Buster&amp;rsquo;s in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman&amp;rsquo;s terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to have bees in here. Mission Accomplished. It&amp;rsquo;s OUR nausea. Chickens don&amp;rsquo;t clap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I&amp;rsquo;ve ever taken! ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you&amp;rsquo;re Annyong! I made a huge tiny mistake. She&amp;rsquo;s always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom&amp;rsquo;s awesome. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. She calls it a Mayonegg. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Got a big ass room at the travelodge. What a fun, sexy time for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. In fact, it was a box of Oscar&amp;rsquo;s legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. Hey, look at that – you&amp;rsquo;re mean sober, too. Michael, I&amp;rsquo;m your older brother. I&amp;rsquo;ll never be proud of you. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she&amp;rsquo;s shaped like a… she&amp;rsquo;s the belle of the ball! We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn&amp;rsquo;t make that in three months. Come on! I may have committed some light treason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I&amp;rsquo;m white! The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
